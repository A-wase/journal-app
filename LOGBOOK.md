# Logbook
Welcome to my logbook: a personal and reflective journal capturing my thinking process, decisions, and experiments. This space serves as a non-linear record of ideas, insights, and progress, offering a glimpse into the journey behind the work. It is similar to `CHANGELOG.md` but less technical. Logbooks are looser by nature: notes, drafts, brainstorming and many abandoned ideas. Keeping it separate from `CHANGELOG.md` encourages more honest and useful reflection from myself... If only there were some kind of app designed specifically for jotting down thoughts and plans... oh well, guess Iâ€™ll just use this file.

### **App data conversion**
I am in the process of trying to parse my previous journal data from a CSV file and converting it into a SQLite database file. I got the CSV from the current journal app that I use. I wish to use my existing data in my own app. The app also has another export choice: an encrypted custom file with more of my data.

I have good news and bad news.

The good news...
I have succeeded in reverse engineering this application's custom ".REDACTED" app data export file. I have redacted the actual file name to preserve the app's identity.

I have discovered that this is actually just a zip file.

I first renamed the file and replaced ".REDACTED" with ".zip"

Inside the zip file was another REDACTED file. This one was not a zip. It was an encoded file. It was encoded in base64.

I reversed the encoding and a JSON file was output.

I viewed the contents of the JSON code with a online JSON viewer and it contained all my data. It had everything. My thousands of entries, my saved custom-activities, my in-app settings. It literally had everything important for the app.

The bad news is that I cannot use this data. It would take the absolute pain to clean up. It has a lot of unnecessary stuff and I do not have energy for this.

My solution: I will instead choose to use the CSV file and clean that up and then convert it into a SQLite database. It is much easier to go this route because the CSV does not have a lot of bloat into it. The JSON is my full in-app data and written journal data. The CSV is just my written journal data and it is in a more concise format, albeit strange formatting code with "utf-8-sig".

### **Design Decision: Separation of Data into `journal.db` and `settings.db`**

To improve modularity, privacy, and flexibility, I decided to separate user content from app configuration by creating two SQLite databases:

* `journal.db`: Stores user-generated content such as journal entries, moods, activities, and notes.
* `settings.db`: Stores in-app settings like UI themes, preferences, and custom configurations.

This structure allows users to export/share only their journal data without exposing personal settings. It also enables settings sharing between users without affecting journal content. This separation improves maintainability, supports safer imports/exports, and lays the groundwork for potential features like theme sharing or settings versioning.  I will then chnage my old SQL database schema to match the new one.
