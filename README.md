## Why I made this journal app
I created this journal app for personal use and as a way to learn more about the Streamlit library and SQLite. Initially, I planned to build this project using Tkinter and to export the database into Microsoft Excel. However, as I worked on improving my programming skills, I researched better database management solutions beyond simple Excel file exports. That‚Äôs when I decided to use SQLite.

While saving data as an Excel or CSV file might have been a viable alternative, I believed that Excel spreadsheets could become slow when handling large amounts of data. More importantly, my main goal was to learn, experiment, and grow as a developer. I was particularly excited to discover Streamlit and explore SQL-based data management within my own project.

In the end, I successfully built this simple yet functional journal app, and I‚Äôm proud of what I‚Äôve learned along the way. The app itself is nothing fancy, complicated, or groundbreaking, but it serves its purpose well. It provides a simple and intuitive way to jot down thoughts, reflect on past entries, and helped me practice working with databases and web-based Python applications. More than anything, it represents my progress as a developer and my excitement for learning new technologies.
